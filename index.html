                            Hi everyone.<br>
                            I would like to talk with you about writing faster code. Last time I gave a short talk on how to make your Python code faster, I remember someone pointing out that 'basically you can rewrite your code in C to make it faster'.<br>
                            And you know what ? The guy was absolutely right. Take any piece of code, rewrite it in C or C++ and it will be automatically faster.<br>
                            So I was thinking, "Hmm, if I say just 'writing faster code', people will be confused if it's only about Python or not".<br>
                            So I decided to fix it.<br>

                            I was very happy with the new title. It makes it clear that we are not talking about Java or C here.<br>
                            But then I remembered from school that the presentation title should be clear but also concise.
                            And frankly - this one barely even fits on the slides.<br>
                            So I had to fix it again.<br>

                            Python was not created to be a fast language that you would use for some LHC computations where every nanosecond counts.<br>
                            And that's fine. Python is a great programming language that is very easy to learn and easy to use.<br>
                            It's very easy to write some throw-away prototypes.<br>
                            You can use it for writing web applications, simple scripts and for all those use cases it's fast enough.

                        In my examples, I have used the %timeit magic function that comes with IPython. It has some overhead over the standard timeit library, but it doesn't really matter - as long as we use the same method to measure execution time of different functions, we only need to know which method is faster and how many times.

                        Let's start with something simple. Let's say you want to count a number of elements in a list. You can easily write a simple loop than increments a counter and there is nothing wrong with this code, except that it's slow. You can achieve the same results using the built-in function len(). And as you can see the speed improvement is quite huge.
                        So, try to use the built-in functions and functions from the standard library when you can.
                        <<< ADD a separate slide with the list of python 3.5.1 built-ins >>>
                        Python 3.5.1 contains 68 built-in variables [source](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html) - you won't need all of them (I don't remember when was the list time - if ever - I used (xxx - find function names here), but it will take you just a moment to take a look at that list from time to time and keep it in the back of your head.

                        Let's say you want to check if some variable or an expression is true. You can explicitly compare this variable to True, but unless you really want to check if a variable is really True (and not 0 or None)  you can simplify your condition to just 'if variable'. It will return True, unless the variable is False, None, 0, empty string, empty list or any other "Falsy" expression. And by doing that, your instruction get almost twice faster.

                        The same rule applies when checking for False, the fastest way to do this is to use 'if not variable', unless you really need to distinguish False from None, 0 or other Falsy values.

                        When you want to execute a piece of code, but you are not sure it will be successful (maybe some variables are not set or maybe performing a specific operation will throw as exception), so you want to protect yourself somehow. The first way you can do this is called 'Look before you leap' or ask for permission. What is means is that you check if all variables are set and everything is fine and then you perform you operations. Usually this checking is performed with the if statement.
                        However, there is a different approach that you could use - it's called "Beg for forgiveness". In this scenario, you perform your operation without checking the conditions, but in case you expect that something might break, you wrap you code in try/except block and catch the exceptions that were raised.
                        As you can see in this example, begging for forgiveness is 3,5 times faster.

                        But it gets even better if you are checking for more conditions.
                        Here, we are checking if 3 attributes are available. Asking for permissions is still slower and now it gets more difficult to read.
                        Following the beg for forgiveness principle will result in faster and more readable code
                        So, is asking for forgiveness instead of checking the permissions always the best choice ?

                        Well, not really. The exception handling is still quite expensive performance wise.
                        If the object doesn't have the attribute we are looking for, begging for forgiveness will be slower than asking for permissions.
                        So as a rule of thumb, you can use the 'Ask for permissions' way if you know that it's very probably that there will be some uninitialized variables or other problems.
                        Otherwise if you are expecting your code to run smoothly most of the time (for example, you are fetching some files from the internet and you are expecting that it will work, unless there is no internet connection) using try/except will be the faster and quite often cleaner way to go.
                        But again, I strongly advise you to measure both solutions to see which one is faster in your scenario.

                        But we can do better than this. Dictionaries have a get method, that you should use in a case like that.

                        Let's talk about string for now. If you have a list of strings and want to concatenate them into one string, using a loop is not the best idea. Instead, you can use the join function, that will be much faster (and clearer to understand). Here, for a list of 1000 words, the join function is 11 times faster. I have also tested it with longer words and even though the difference got lower (for 1000 words of 600 characters, join was 'only' twice as fast), join function is still a clear winner here.

                        Let's say you want to filter a list of 1 million elements and select only those, that are matching some condition.
                        The naive version would be to use for loop, but I already showed you that in most cases, for loops are bad.
                        You can use the built-in filter function instead. In Python2, filter was returning the list directly. In Python3, it's returning an iterator, so I need to explicitly convert the results of filter function to a list to get the same results as in case of the loop.
                        This conversion impacts the performance, but even without some overhead for list function, you can see that filter performs much slower.
                        Why does this happen ? Well, the fact that filter is now returning an iterator is a good suggestion that this is a wrong use case for filter function.
                        If we want to get the whole list as a result, the better idea is to use list comprehension. It's around 35% faster than the for loop and - at least for me - it looks much better.

                        Let's take a look at different ways of defining functions in Python. The most common way to create a function is with def keyword. The other way is to declare an anonymous function with lambda. If you assign this lambda to a variable it will act in the same way as function created with def keyword.
                        So let's see which version is faster.
                        Well, actually they are both equally fast.
                        Why ? Because both version exactly the same thing.
                        We can see that even better when disassembling the code of both function.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        So is there any difference ?
                        Well, if your function has more than one line, then you can't use lambda.
                        Also, you can't really put documentation inside lambda function.
                        And if you have PEP-8 enabled in you code editor, it will complain each time you try to assign lambda to a variable.
                        And he is right, lambda works really nice when you need a simple one-liner callback for functions, especially for functions like filter, map or reduce.
                        There are also some quite narrow use cases when it might be necessary to use the lambda instead of def as a callback - if you want to read more, I'm linking a stack overflow question with that problem.
                        However, for any other case, I would use def. It's much cleaner, you can document it properly and the performance is the same.
